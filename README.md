## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learnt how to use grid for optimal layout in some sections also learnt how to properly place the background.

```css
body{
    background-color: #fff;
    background-image: url(/images/bg-header-mobile.png);
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-size: 100vw;
}
.info{
        display: grid;
        grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
        align-items: center;
    }
```


### Continued development

I'll continue working on properly using css grid for optimal layouts and also working with backgrounds properly.
Will also have to learn coloring with svg elements.
